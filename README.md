## Getting Started

#### Download EnhanceDocs

- Cloning this repository `git clone git@github.com:enhancedocs/enhancedocs.git`

or

- Using docker image `docker pull enhancedocs/enhancedocs`

#### Set up env variables

Use the `.example.env` as a template and fill with the required fields.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required; EnhanceDocs relies on [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)
- `ENHANCEDOCS_API_KEY` is optional; By default you can ingest data into EnhanceDocs without an API Key, 
so you can work conformable in your local environment, 
but we highlight recommend to set this on production if you are exposing the API to the internet.
- `ENHANCEDOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN` is optional; This is a client side token, 
and we recommend its usage together with cors so only your site can make requests to the API.

```bash
cp .example.env .env
```
